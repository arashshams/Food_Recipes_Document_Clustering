# Food_Recipes_Document_Clustering
This repo hosts an Unsupervised Machine Learning model for [Doument Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_clustering) on [Kaggle's Food.com recipes corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions). This corpus contains 180K+ recipes and 700K+ recipe reviews, however in this analysis I will only focus on recipes and not on recipe reviews.

The goal is to extract main categories or groupings of recipes based on their names.

You can also check the Kaggle Kernel for this notebook [here]().
